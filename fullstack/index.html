               <h3>Message from the instructor</h3>
               <p>I have always wondered how codes work; what those jaggons on the screen mean. They made no sense at all until I started tinkering with code myself. </p>
               <p>Programming is not an easy task, no doubt; but anyone who is willing to learn with committment can become a programmer. And once you learn the basics, the rest is fun. </p>
               <p>In this course, I'll walk along with you as you take your journey from being a complete novice to a full-stack developer. Do not rack your head about the ups and downs, we will go through everything together. At the end of the course, you will be proud to display your projects on your portfolio. You'd have become a sought after full-stack web developer.</p>
